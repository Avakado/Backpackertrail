# About
This is build for test task Backpackertrail

# Technologies
For this task i decide to use [`Vue.js 3`](https://vuejs.org/) because have enough expirience with it and also in real project
if some other developer will join he will easy understand whats going on(of course if he know vue too) - structure, code convention etc. Also i use [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) tool for project building it faster then webpack and have better code optimisation. For styling i used [`windicss`](https://windicss.org/) utility-first CSS framework it give easy way to modify  components ui even if it have very custom design so you can change every things you need
For carousel component i used ready made solution [`vue3-carousel](https://ismail9k.github.io/vue3-carousel/)
